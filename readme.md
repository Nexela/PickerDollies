# Picker Dollies

Hover over entities and use the Picker dolly keybinds to move entities around. Entities will keep their wire connections and settings. This allows you to build your set up spaced out and when you are finished push it all together for a nice tight build. Some entities can't be shoved around. Also respects max wire distance. Note Moving some modded entities that rely on position can cause issues. There is an API available that mod authors can use to be notified of these events.
